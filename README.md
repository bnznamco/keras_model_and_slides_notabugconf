# NotABugConf - Image recognition with keras and tensorflow


Here the code and the slides of my talk "Image recognition with keras and tensorflow" at [Not a Bug Conf](https://notabugconf.it/)

## System requirements

All you need is a python 3 virtualenv.

From virtualenv install requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 
## Run code

First train your model with [train_model.py](train_model.py).
It may take a long time since default training are 30 ephocs.

If you want to go straight to model testing you can download the [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NmP7EjG_2h1AIQCcHBgDA0zke-x8wX8A/view?usp=sharing).
And test it with [test_model.py](test_model.py)

## Jupyter notebook

The code is also available with comments in a jupyter notebook.

Here the md to see the result of the complete execution:
1. [train model](jupyter_notebook-md/train_model.md)
2. [test model](jupyter_notebook-md/test_model.md)
